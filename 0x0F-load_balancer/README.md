## LOAD BALANCER

In this project, I continued to build up the configuration of the web server issued in projects: `0x0B-ssh` & `0x0C. Web Server`. I was issued two additional servers, one to replicate the Nginx configuration of my original server, and another to set up an HAproxy load balancer on to manage both web servers.
