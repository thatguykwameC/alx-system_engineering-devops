## Networking Basics

**1. The OSI Model:**

* A framework for understanding network communication, with **7 layers** performing specific tasks.
* Imagine a restaurant order (application layer) moving through different departments (lower layers) to reach the customer.

**2. Network Types:**

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** Connects devices in a limited area (home, office) for sharing resources (printers, files, internet). 
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans a larger geographical area (states, countries) to connect LANs or distant users.

**3. The Internet:**

* A global network of interconnected networks, enabling worldwide communication and resource sharing.
* Think of it as a vast web of interconnected LANs and WANs.

**4. IP Address:**

* A unique identifier for each device on a network, like a house address in the digital world.
* There are two main types: IPv4 (dominant now) and IPv6 (developed for future expansion).

**5. Localhost:**

* A special IP address (usually 127.0.0.1) referring to the device itself, used for internal communication and testing.
* Think of it as a self-referential address within a device.

**6. Subnet:**

* A way to divide a large network into smaller, more manageable segments for better control and efficiency.
* Imagine a large building divided into floors (subnets) for better organization.

**7. IPv6:**

* Created due to the limitations of IPv4, primarily the shortage of unique addresses with the growing number of devices.
* Offers a significantly larger address space for future internet expansion.

**8. TCP/UDP:**

* **TCP (reliable):** Ensures data arrives complete and in the correct order, like a certified mail package with tracking.
* **UDP (faster, less reliable):** Used for applications where speed is more important than guaranteed delivery, like real-time streaming.
* Think of sending a regular letter which might arrive faster but isn't guaranteed.

**9. Ports:**

* Virtual channels on a device designated for specific services or applications, like doorways leading to different departments in a building.
* We will memorize common port numbers for protocols like SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).

**10. Checking Device Connectivity:**

* **Ping:** A tool used to send test messages and measure response time, verifying if another device is on the network.
* Imagine knocking on a door to see if someone is home (on the network).
